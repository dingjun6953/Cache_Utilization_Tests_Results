# Cache_Utilization_Tests_Results
# if the data is too big and does not fit the cache size, how about the run time cost? 
# if the data completely fits the cache size, how about the run time cost? 
# Performance comparisons between Default SSE2 instruction sets and the latest AVX512 instruction sets
# Performance comparisons between with vectorization and without vectorization
#you may find resuls and conclude from the test results given in the excel files.
